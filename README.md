## 💭 Reflection Prompts

During breaks, the app presents thoughtful questions to help you pause and reflect:

**Short breaks:**
- What did you accomplish in this session?
- What challenged you most?
- Is your current approach working?
- Are you working on what matters?

**Long breaks:**
- What progress have you made today?
- Are you solving the right problem?
- What assumptions should you question?
- How can you approach this more simply?

## 📊 Statistics & Reports

### Session Summary

At the end of each session, you'll see statistics including:
- Total pomodoros completed
- Sessions skipped
- Total work time
- Total break time

Your session data (including the title and goal if provided) is automatically saved to a SQLite database at `~/.pomo/pomo.db` for future reference.

## 🛠️ The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method:

1. **Work** for 25 minutes (one "pomodoro")
2. **Short break** for 5 minutes
3. After 4 pomodoros, take a **long break** (15-30 minutes)
4. Repeat the cycle

This tool implements this technique with customizable durations to fit your workflow.
